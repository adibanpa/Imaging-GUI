# Imaging-GUI

This project was developped to process the collected by the DaVis software in the UofT geotectonics lab. The DaVis software produced images from motion sensitive cameras. The images collected were from a "sandbox" model where grains of sand are traced to model the deformation due to stresses applied to an earth-like model.

## tm.py

This script uses fourier analysis to segregate the displacement of sand grains during the deformation process.

## missioncontrol.py

This script creates the GUI environment to plot various properties of the images from the DaVis software in addition to combining the images into an animation.

## houston.py

This scripts contains the different function that plot different attributes of the images.
